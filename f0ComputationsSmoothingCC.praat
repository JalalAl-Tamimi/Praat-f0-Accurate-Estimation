## 01 April 2011: version 1. Using autocorrelation pitch estimate (for details, see Al-Tamimi and Khattab, 2015, JASA, 138(1): 344â€“360).  
## 25 May 2017: version 2. A few updates (for details, see Al-Tamimi and Khattab, 2018, Journal of Phonetics, Special Issue on VOT, Volume 71, pages: 306-325) 
## 22 August 2020: version 3: new computations based on cross-correlation. See f0ComputationsSmoothingAC.praat for auto-correlation
## Estimation of Pitch is based on the two-pass method.
